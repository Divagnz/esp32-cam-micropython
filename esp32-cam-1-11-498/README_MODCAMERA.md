I have improved the modcamera.c code to incorporate seven new additional functions:


1) framesize

2) quality

3) contrast

4) saturation

5) brightness

6) speffect

7) whitebalance


They are all callable after camera.init(), which means, we can change those properties at the run time.

Raed this post in my blog.
