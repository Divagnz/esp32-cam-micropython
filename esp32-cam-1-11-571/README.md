You can compile and build you own firmware by following this [workflow](https://github.com/shariltumin/esp32-cam-micropython/blob/master/esp32-cam-1-11-498/README.md)

For this firmware I modified one more file, [mpconfigboard.h](https://github.com/shariltumin/esp32-cam-micropython/blob/master/esp32-cam-1-11-571/boards/GENERIC/mpconfigboard.h) which give label to MicroPython.
